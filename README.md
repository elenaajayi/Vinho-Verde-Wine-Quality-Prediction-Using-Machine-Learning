# Vinho-Verde-Wine-Quality-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to predict the quality of Vinho Verde wine based on its physicochemical properties. We employ a Gradient Boosting Regressor model optimized using Bayesian optimization techniques to improve accuracy, evaluated by Mean Squared Error (MSE).
